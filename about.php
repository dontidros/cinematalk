            Anyone of us (at certain age) realizes that he or she has been seeing thousands of movies during their lifetime. There is notning equivalent for that, even if someone really loves to read its still doesn't reach for this spectrum. Besides that, there are many different ways for experiencing movies: you can concentrate real hard or just stare at the screen. You can get emotionally involved with the occurrences or just be a distant observer. You can treat movies as a form of art but you can also use them for killing time. either way movies are fun and every one of us has his own authentic experience with them. When it comes to movies, like almost anything else, often times it happens that we read reviews at the newspaper or hear opinions which we don't agree with. A lot of times we say to ourselves "This person doesn't know what he is talking about" or "I could phrase that much better" or "They are all missing the point here". So this Blog is for people who feel like writing or even just saying something about movies. You can write a long and scholastic article but you can also write a simple small paragraph with a few sentences. You can write about every movie you like, no metter which ganre it relates or how good or bad it is. It can be a movie that represent sublime artistry or a movie fills with blows and explosions. It can be a popular blockbuster movie or an esoteric movie that almost no one has ever heard of. You can write reviews if you like, but Your posts doesn't necessarily have to contain criticism or judgemental tone. And another important emphasis: there is no age limitation for this blog and whether you’re a small child or adult, everyone are welcome to contribute their insights to this project. The only thing to keep in mind is clean language and do not get offensive. So we hope you will join this Blog and we all have nice enjoyable and fruitful discussion.</strong>
